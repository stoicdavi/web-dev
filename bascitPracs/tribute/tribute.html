        <p>Whenever we are face with any challenge in the family, my elder broteher is alway ready to chip in give a hand and save the situation. He is very steadfast alway holding hour family together even though he his own chilren to look after.</p>
        <p>Ever since we lost our dad in the year 2011, this God given elder brother of ours held our family he and him a lone, by then He was the only person who had employment in our family.
             He has to make sure that the little salary that he got from his Job was equally distributed to his family as well as to us as his sibling. I have never heard him complain even a single day. He has always provided to the family like the father of the family</p>

        <p>Kindness and Hardwork are just virtues for my brother, they are the cornerstone of his character. I admire the way he do support a lot of students to persue their studies by <strong>paying for their school fees.</strong><br>
        I and most of my sibling are beneficiaries of his <strong>Kindness.</strong> He has supported me throughout my learning journey, since we lost our dad, he is the one who has been paying for the family bills as well as making sure that we are not being chased out of school due to school fees issues.,<br>
    Many chilren have been able to attend to school through his kind act of paying for them school fees.</p>
    <h4>Hardwork</h4>
    <p>The virtue of harwork is very evident in <span style="color: brown;"><b>the success story of my brother, He has </b></span>been through a lot but he never gave up. He kept pushing on and on. <br>
    He manages several busnesses and one thing I raelly like about him is his humbleness</p>

        <p>My brother has overcome the obstacles in life to serve as an example of the effectiveness of perseverance and foresight.
